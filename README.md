# TOC Depth Extension For Quarto

A Quarto extension that provides fine-grained control over table of contents depth at the header level.

## Installation

```bash
quarto add mcanouil/quarto-toc-depth
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Usage

Add the filter to your document's YAML header:

```yaml
filters:
  - toc-depth
```

Then control TOC depth for specific sections using the `toc-depth` attribute on headers: `{toc-depth=N}`.

> [!NOTE]
> The TOC depth is relative to the section where it is defined.

```markdown
# Section A {toc-depth=0}

This section and its subsections will not appear in the TOC.

## Subsection A1

This will be hidden from TOC.

# Section B {toc-depth=1}

This section will appear in the TOC, but its direct children will be hidden.

## Subsection B1

This will NOT appear in TOC (depth = 2).

### Subsection B1.1

This will NOT appear in TOC (depth = 3).

# Section C {toc-depth=2}

This section will appear in the TOC, along with its direct children.

### Subsection C1.1
