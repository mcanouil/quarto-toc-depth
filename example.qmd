# Installation

```bash
quarto add mcanouil/quarto-toc-depth
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

# Usage

Add the filter to your document's YAML header:

```yaml
filters:
  - toc-depth
```

Then control TOC depth for specific sections using the `toc-depth` attribute on headers: `{toc-depth=N}`.

:::: {.callout-note}
The TOC depth is relative to the section where it is defined.
